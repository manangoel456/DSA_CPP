The Tower of Hanoi, also referred to as the Tower of Brahma, is a mathematical puzzle that was formulated by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883.

This puzzle is characterized by three rods (labelled A, B, and C) and several disks of varying sizes that can be moved among the rods. 
Initially, all the disks are stacked on one rod, with the smallest disk on top, forming a shape reminiscent of a cone.

The goal of the puzzle is to relocate the entire stack of disks to a different rod. However, there are specific rules that must be adhered to during this process:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
